\title{Example of a RVG that can be used with all range tests}
\usage{
rvgt.range.rdist.example(n, shape1, shape2, kind, show.properties = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{size of random sample. (numeric)}

\item{shape1}{parameter 1 for distribution. (numeric)}

\item{shape2}{parameter 2 for distribution. (numeric)}

\item{kind}{parameter for generator (independent from the
parameter for the distribution. (numeric)}

\item{show.properties}{if \code{TRUE} properties of the generator and the generated
       samples (like the rejection constant) should be stored
       as attributes of the returned vector.}
}
\value{
The function returns an array of size \code{n} that contains the
requested random sample. If \code{show.properties=TRUE} then
properties of the generator are stored as attributes of the
returned vector. These properties are required by (or are at least
optional for) some range tests.
Currently the following properties (attributes) are set:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"trc"}}{
        theoretical rejection constant
        (required by \code{\link{rvgt.range.trc}})}
  \item{\code{"orc"}}{
        observed rejection constant
        (required by \code{\link{rvgt.range.orc}})}
}
}
\description{
Prototype implementation for a random variate generator \code{rdist}
that can be used with all range tests.
}
\details{
Function \code{rvgt.range.rdist.example} is a prototype
implementation of a random variate generator \code{rdist} that can
be used with all range tests that make use of engine
\code{\link{rvgt.range.engine}}.

This function shows all obligatory and optional arguments to
\code{rdist} as well as all possible return values and attributes that
are required by at least one of some tests.

In this example \code{shape1} and \code{shape2} are the parameters
for the distribution and their values have to be passed by
means of argument \code{dist.params} to routine
\code{\link{rvgt.range.engine}}. Of course there can be only one
parameter or more than two such parameters.
Argument \code{kind} is an additional parameter for the generator
function. Its values have to be passed by
means of argument \code{r.params} to routine
\code{\link{rvgt.range.engine}}. Of course there need not be such
a parameter and there also can be more than one such parameter.

Argument \code{show.properties} is used to enable storing properties
of the generator as attributes of the returned random sample.

Although this example generator returns beta random variates it
only demonstrates the API for \code{rdist}.
