\title{Estimate setup time of random variate generator}
\usage{
rvgt.range.setup(rdist, dist.params, r.params = list(), duration = 0.1,
  gen.time = duration, repetitions = 1L, ncores = NULL, timeout = Inf,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{repetitions}{number of repetitions of the test. Then the median of the
       test results is used to estimate the setup time
       (positive integer).}

\item{rdist}{random number generator for distribution (function).}

\item{dist.params}{parameters for distribution (non-empty list).}

\item{r.params}{additional arguments for \code{rdist} (list).}

\item{duration}{scheduled duration for a single test in seconds (numeric).}

\item{gen.time}{(approximate) marginal generation time for \code{rdist}.
       It must be either a single positive number (numeric) or
       an object of class \code{"rvgt.range.time"} that holds the
       result of a previous call to routine \code{\link{rvgt.range.marginal}}.}

\item{ncores}{enable multicore support for performing tests in
       parallel and for setting timeout.
       The following values are possible:
       \itemize{
       \item \code{NULL}:
             the tests run sequentially on a single core.
       \item A positive integer:
             the tests run on \code{ncores} cores in parallel.
             Notice that \code{ncores=1L} is possible.
             Although then only one core is used the behavior
             is different from \code{ncores=NULL}.
       \item \code{0L}:
             the number of available cores is autodetected by means of
             \code{\link[parallel]{detectCores}}.
       }
       Multicore support is only available on POSIX-compliant OSes
       (basically every but Windows OSes).}

\item{timeout}{set a timeout in seconds for each test (numeric).
This allows to protect against unexpected long running times
or infinite loops.
It requires multicore support which is enabled by setting
argument \code{ncores}.
(When a timeout is set then \code{ncores} is automatically
set to \code{1L} if it is not already set by the user.)}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE show progress.
       Ignored when multicore support is enabled and 'ncores' > 1 (logical).}
}
\value{
The function returns an object of class \code{"rvgt.range.time.setup"}
where the observed setup times are stored in field \code{$data},
see \code{\link{rvgt.range.engine}} for a description of such objects.
The routine returns \code{NA} in all cases where the setup failed, and
\code{Inf} when a timeout has been reached.
}
\description{
Estimate running time of setup and generation of one random number
for the given random variate generator for a range of parameters.
}
\details{
Routine \code{rvgt.range.setup} estimates the running for generating
exactly one random number (inluding the setup of the generatur)
with the given random variate generator for a range of parameters.
(This corresponds to the \dQuote{varying parameter case} in applications).
For this purpose the running time returned by
\code{\link{system.time}} is used.

The scheduled sampling time for a particular combination of parameters
is given by parameter \code{duration}. Notice that it must not be too
small compared to the resolution of the system clock.
The required sample size is then estimated in a sequence of tries where
the sample size is increasing after each run.
This iterative process is stopped if the total running time is close to
\code{duration}.

The total running time for sampling one random variate can be too small
compared to the resolution of the system clock. Thus the call to
generator \code{rdist} has to be repeated sufficiently often using a
\code{for} loop. However, this also includes the overhead for calling an
\R function. For experimental generators that are implemented at C level
there is a workaround: if generator \code{rdist} accepts argument \code{rep}
it is assumed that this \code{for} loop is implemented at C level, too,
where \code{rep} is the number of repetitions.

Timings can vary considerably. In order to get a more robust estimate
one can repeat this test several times and use the median of all timings.
This can be achieved by means of argument \code{repetitions}.
Notice, that this of course increases the total running time.
This has to be taken into account if a timeout is set.

A big issue of tests on a large range of parameter settings is that the
running times may not be known in advance. Thus the total running time of
the test suite may be extremely long due to some unexpected long runs
for some tests.
In order to avoid such problems the running times for each test can be
limited by means of argument \code{timeout} which required to enable
multicore support using \code{ncores}.
