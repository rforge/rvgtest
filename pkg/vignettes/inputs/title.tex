\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
  Non-uniform random variate generators are of fundamental importance
  in Monte-Carlo methods and stochastic simulation. They are based on
  the assumption that a source of uniformly distributed random numbers
  is available that produces real and truely random numbers.
  In practice, however, we have to use pseudo-random numbers which are
  generated by means of floating point numbers.
  Thus there are deviations from the theoretical framework caused by 
  round-off errors which are due to the limitations of floating point
  arithmetic. In addition algorithm have to developed and
  implemented. As human can err coding errors or mistakes in the
  design of algorithm may cause defects in a generated random sample.
  It is of paramount importance to detect such errors using
  statistical tools and categorize which tests are sensitive to which
  errors. 

  \rvgtest\ is a collection of routines for testing non-uniform random
  variate generators. They hopefully should help to detect all kinds
  of error. Thus it provides routines for goodness-of-fit tests that
  are based on histograms and routines to estimate approximation
  errors for numerical inversion.
